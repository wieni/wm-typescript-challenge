# Search (Recipes page)

## User story

```
As a user I can search for a cocktail on the recipes page
```

## âœ… Acceptance criteria

- I can see a nicely styled search input field on the recipes page that I can use to filter the list of cocktails based on their name.
- Make sure you add a reasonable debounce to the search input.
- Make use of a search library to help with the search functionality. (react-query, swr, ...)
- Spice up the search input with functionalities such as a clear button, suggestions, autocomplete, etc.
